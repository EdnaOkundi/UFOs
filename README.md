# UFOs Overview:

This challenge was to help Dana have a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter 
for multiple criteria at the same time. 

Results:

In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
I also created a basic HTML web page. Using the UFO dataset that was provided in the form of 
an array of JavaScript objects, a code that appends a table to your web page was written
and then new rows of data for each UFO sighting were added; keeping in mind the columns
for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

I used a date form in my HTML document to write JavaScript code that will listen 
for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote a JavaScript code so
the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the
following criteria based on the table columns: date/time, city, state, country, shape.

Summary: 

In a summary, one major drawback was getting the correct Java Script codes that could filter search and call functions; 
besides removing the list from HTML.

Recommendations:

1. Update JavaScript codes to be more specific to a function, since most of them look similar hence confusing.
